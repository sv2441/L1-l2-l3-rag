- Be dynamic and easily adaptive, particularly in a highly fluid threat environment (e.g., a public-facing Internet service)"

Codes of Data Ethics typically incorporate some variant of the following general principles:
1. Data elements are entwined with a real person – first do no harm.
2. The effects of DM are inequitable, including some and excluding others.
3. Ensure future data use is consistent with expectations & intentions of its originators.
4. Provenance & tools for analysis must be documented, because they affect how data is presented & used.
5. Be explicit about how the organization’s data practices do and do not align with context-dependent expectations.
6. Collect only the data required for the task at hand; less data is less open to misuse.
7. Data subjects have a right to know what data is collected and how that data is used and/or shared. Be open and transparent.
8. Aim to be a leader in data ethics for long-term success.
